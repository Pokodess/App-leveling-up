# App-leveling-up

I'm passionate about the gamification of life.
I think that we can easily make our life as addictive as a game.

However it will be even more simple if we have an app to measure our progress.

The goal is to make an app, very simple to use.

You can choose or create tasks.

The difficulty of your task is evaluated by an AI.

You receive XP, items, titles etc... based on the difficulty of the task.

We'll dive into complex ideas later.
